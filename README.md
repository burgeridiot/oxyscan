# Oxyscan
Oxyscan is a simple Python app built with Flet designed to work with hospitals that handle lots of oxygen bottles and that can't keep up with all of them. It allows you to:
- Add oxygen bottles on your device, with location, condition and even the patient using it available as additional information you can add.
- Save a localized list of bottles, and upload them to a database later if you are in a area without network.
- Not worry about setting up new devices for the app, as you can import a list of current bottles from said database, allowing you to just install the app on a new device and start immediately using it.
- Host your own Oxyscan server for free as this uses SQL for its database.

This app requires Android 4.0+.
